        <h2 style="color: black;"><b>Au Tau porridge</b></h2>
        <p>The bowl of porridge has a fatty taste mixed with a bit of bitterness from au tau, a delicious smell from chicken eggs and accompanying herbs. Au tau is a typical tuber of Ha Giang. The Mong people soak au tau in rice water, then simmer them for about 4-5 hours. Then puree, cook with bone broth and yellow flower sticky rice mixed with a little regular sticky rice. When the porridge is cooked, it will be scooped into a bowl and eaten with minced lean meat, salt, pepper and scallions. Au Tau is a nutritious dish that cures colds, aches and pains… During cold winter days in the rocky mountains, enjoying a bowl of hot, nutritious Au Tau porridge is definitely an unforgettable experience</p>
        <h2 style="color: black;"><b>Thang Co</b></h2>
        <p>Thang Co means meat soup, a traditional dish of the Mong people, made from horse meat with a very unique flavour. Nowadays, to suit tourists, the restaurant owner has replaced the ingredients with buffalo, cow, and pork meat. The essence of Thang Co is in the broth, simmered from bones and organs and mixed with 12 typical spices such as star anise, cardamom and lemon leaves... creating a fragrant pot of broth. The meat will be lightly fried and then placed in broth to simmer until soft. It is often eaten with Men Men, grilled corn cakes and corn wine.</p>
        <h2 style="color: black;"><b>Five-colour sticky rice</b></h2>
        <img src="https://vietnam.travel/sites/default/files/inline-images/ha-giang-09_1685043960-edit.jpg" alt="" class="anhbe">
        <p>This dish appears in mostly all ethnic minorities in the mountainous regions of Northern Vietnam. In a nutshell, the thing that creates the colour of the rice is not chemical substance but the natural leaves. The five colours of the dish represent the five elements of life in the Vietnamese's belief: yellow is earth, green is plant, red is fire, white is metal, and black is water. People believe that the existence of these five elements create the well-being of heaven, the earth and humans.</p>
        <h2 style="color: black;"><b>Buckwheat cake</b></h2>
        <p>The tiny seeds were crushed into fine powder and then mixed with water, poured into a soft mould rolled into bread, simple but special. The taste will not be confused with any other cake.
            Visitors to Ha Giang to experience buckwheat flower paradise should not miss the opportunity to enjoy specialties made from buckwheat seeds that are delicious, unique, and popular such as: All kinds of cakes, pho, beer, noodles, dry rice vermicelli, wine. Buckwheat is a flowering herb with many colours of white, pink, purple, and red, and has long been famous as one of the symbolic flowers of Ha Giang.</p>
        <h2 style="color: black;"><b>Hunchback chung cake</b></h2>
        <p>Hunchback chung cake is known as a famous dish of the Red Dao people in particular and the Ha Giang region in general. The cake contains upland sticky rice, small green beans, black pork raised mainly by local people, and galangal leaves to wrap. Hunchback chung cake is boiled for about 8-10 hours. Local people boil cakes using traditional wood stoves.</p>
